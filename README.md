# Accord's Malware Scanner Service

This is a fork of [docker-clamav-malware-scanner](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/docker-clamav-malware-scanner).

Modified to run on existing upload buckets and NO-OP if a file that is scanned is malware free.

*Note* in config.json buckets.clean will be ignored but must be unique from unscanned
